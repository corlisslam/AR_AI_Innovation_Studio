    sectionName: Tour part 1.3 What Are Qubits?
    behaviorTreeConstants: 
    objective: '<speak> Quantum computers create higher dimensional spaces to solve
      problems classical computers can''t. Qubits, the basic units of quantum computing,
      can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time through superposition. These qubits
      are manipulated by quantum gates, which control their state and interactions.


      Quantum
      gates perform operations like putting qubits in superposition or entangling
      them, enabling complex calculations by leveraging quantum phenomena.


      The
      power of quantum computing grows exponentially with more qubits, allowing it
      to tackle problems beyond classical computing.


      Do you have any questions?
      Please let me know if you would like to proceed to the next section of the
      tour or the previous section.</speak>

      If the user has any questions,
      answer them. If the user wants to repeat this section, restart this section
      again.'

    sectionName: Tour part 1.1 Intro
    behaviorTreeConstants: 
    objective: '<speak> Great let''s begin!  So what you can see here is a quantum
      computer. In a real life scenario, you would have a classical computer connected
      to your quantum computer with hundreds of coaxial cables. The whole structure
      often resembles a chandelier.


      90% of what you can see in the structure
      is a dilution refrigerator. The reason why there is a fridge is that you need
      to cool down your qubits to temperatures close to absolute zero, which is around
      0.01 Kelvin (about -273.14 Celsius). To get an idea of how cold this is, it''s
      significantly colder than outer space, which is approximately 2.7 Kelvin.


      Do
      you have any questions? Please let me know if you would like to proceed to
      the next section of the tour.

    sectionName: Tour part 1.2 Cooling
    behaviorTreeConstants: 
    objective: '<speak> Cooling the qubits removes noise, allowing them to function
      at a quantum level. The design here is a demo; IBM''s actual designs are proprietary.
      Helium-3 and Helium-4 gases flow through the system, cooling each level to
      near absolute zero.


      At the bottom is the quantum processor, where qubits
      are stored and operations happen. You submit circuits via a classical computer,
      which sends microwave signals to the processor to perform operations at near
      absolute zero. The results are then sent back to your system.


      This
      process lets quantum computers perform complex calculations while keeping qubits
      in a quantum state.

    sectionName: Tour part 2.1 Problem 1
    behaviorTreeConstants: 
    objective: "<speak>There are three categories of problems that quantum computers
      can solve. The first one is optimization problems, which are anything that
      requires hundreds of parameters. \n\nFor example, Exxon Mobil transports liquid
      nitrogen gas around the world. The delivery needs to be done on time while
      factoring in different parameters such as the number of ships available, the
      number of ports available for different countries and the number of employees
      available on that day. On top of that there are things that you can't accurately
      predict, such as if a ship is broken down, or if an employee is sick on a certain
      day. There are many many combinations of these parameters to consider and a
      quantum computer is able to look at all those combinations to choose the best
      one to make sure deliveries are done on time.\n\nDo you have any questions?
      Please let me know if you would like to proceed to the next section of the
      tour.</speak> \n\nIf the user has any questions, answer them. If the user wants

    sectionName: Tour part 2.2 Problem 2 and 3
    behaviorTreeConstants: 
    objective: "<speak>The second set of problems are simulation problems, which
      is anything to do with simulating molecules. For instance, it could be simulating
      the coffee molecules, which requires the order of 10 to 49 to solve. With a
      quantum computer, you can simulate the coffee molecules using only 160 qubits.
      \n\nFinally, quantum computers can be used to develop machine learning algorithms,
      as they require a lot of computing power. \n\nDo you have any questions? Please
